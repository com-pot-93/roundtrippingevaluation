One task involves gathering the receiving report, and the other task involves reporting any errors to the relevant team member. \n\nOnce the receiving report is gathered and any errors are reported, the process converges and splits into three parallel tasks. These tasks include checking dates to avoid penalty charges, storing the documents in the paid invoice file, and entering the invoice into the accounts payable account. \n\nAfter checking the dates to avoid penalty charges, the process splits into two parallel tasks. One task involves creating a voucher for the documents, and the other task involves stamping all documents. \n\nFinally, the voucher creation leads to scheduling the payment, and the process concludes with the end event.",

Once the senior accountant has received the documents, a receiving report is created. \n\nAfter the receiving report is created, two tasks are initiated in parallel. One task involves reporting any errors to a team member, while the other task involves confirming that all documents have been amended. \n\nOnce all documents are confirmed to be amended, a double-check of the three-way match is performed. \n\nFollowing the double-check, two tasks are again initiated in parallel. One task involves storing the documents in the paid invoice file, while the other task involves creating a voucher for the documents. \n\nAfter the documents are stored in the paid invoice file, two final tasks are initiated in parallel. One task involves entering the invoice into the accounts payable account, while the other task involves stamping all documents. \n\nThe process concludes with the end event once both the invoice is entered into the accounts payable account and all documents are stamped.",

This leads to another parallel split where two tasks are performed simultaneously: checking the customer payment terms and sending an invoice in the accounting software.\n\nFollowing these tasks, the process enters another parallel split where multiple activities are carried out concurrently. These activities include recording the activity digitally, establishing monthly contact with the client, and making a second physical copy.\n\nOnce all these activities are completed, the process converges and splits again into two parallel paths.

These actions can also be initiated directly after recording the buyer's details.\n\nOnce the credit check is completed, the process continues with checking the customer payment terms and sending the invoice in the accounting software. These actions are performed in parallel.\n\nFollowing this, three parallel actions are carried out: recording the activity digitally, establishing monthly contact with the client, and making a second physical copy.\n\nAfter these actions, the process involves recording sales on credit of goods and recording sales on credit of services, which are also performed in parallel.\n\nFinally, the process concludes with the end event after the sales on credit of goods and services have been recorded.",

Once the buyer's details are recorded, two parallel actions are initiated: sending a credit application form to the buyer and running a credit check on the purchasing company.\n\nAfter sending the credit application form to the buyer, two parallel actions are performed: getting approval for a post-credit check review and sending the buyer the terms of sale.\n\nOnce the credit check on the purchasing company is completed, it converges with the approval for the post-credit check review and the sending of the terms of sale. These three actions lead to checking the customer payment terms and sending an invoice in the accounting software.\n\nFollowing the checking of customer payment terms and the sending of the invoice, three parallel actions are initiated: recording the activity digitally, establishing monthly contact with the client, and making a second physical copy.\n\nAfter recording the activity digitally, establishing monthly contact with the client, and making a second physical copy, the process converges again. The final steps are to record sales on credit of goods and record sales on credit of services. The process concludes with the end event.",

Following this, three tasks are initiated in parallel: getting approval for the post-credit check review, sending the credit application form to the buyer, and sending the buyer the terms of sale. Once the terms of sale are sent, a credit check is run on the purchasing company. \n\nAfter the credit check is completed, three tasks are executed in parallel: generating the invoice, sending the invoice in the accounting software, and checking the customer payment terms. Once these tasks are completed, the activity is recorded digitally, and a second physical copy is made. \n\nFollowing this, monthly contact with the client is established. Finally, two tasks are performed in parallel: recording sales on credit of services and recording sales on credit of goods.

Following this, a parallel gateway determines the next steps: running a credit check on the purchasing company and sending a credit application form to the buyer. Both tasks are executed concurrently.\n\nOnce the credit check is completed and the credit application form is sent, another parallel gateway initiates the generation of an invoice and the sending of the invoice through accounting software. These tasks are also performed simultaneously.\n\nAfter the invoice is generated and sent, the process continues with establishing monthly contact with the client. This leads to another parallel gateway where sales on credit of goods and sales on credit of services are recorded concurrently.\n\nFinally, the process concludes with the end event after recording the sales on credit of goods and services.",

Both paths converge to calculate the total annual budget and estimate the average monthly cost in parallel.\n\nThe results of these calculations are then used to project the total annual income. Once the total annual income is projected, the process splits into two parallel paths again. In the first path, the budget is finalized, and in the second path, financial data is recorded in the budget spreadsheet. Both paths converge to obtain approval from top management.\n\nAfter obtaining approval, the process splits into two parallel paths.

One path involves evaluating significant variances, while the other involves reviewing the most recent budget.\n\nAfter evaluating significant variances, the process continues with defining three to five goals and determining ways of achieving these goals. Similarly, after reviewing the most recent budget, the process also involves defining three to five goals and determining ways of achieving these goals. These two paths converge, and the goals are then prioritized.\n\nFollowing the prioritization of goals, the process splits into two parallel paths again. One path involves calculating the total annual budget, while the other involves estimating the average monthly cost. Both paths converge with the projection of the total annual income.\n\nAfter projecting the total annual income, the process splits into two parallel paths once more. One path involves finalizing the budget, while the other involves recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet. These two paths converge, and the process continues with obtaining approval from top management and requesting approval from top management.\n\nOnce approval is obtained and requested, the process splits into two parallel paths again. One path involves assigning management responsibilities, while the other involves incorporating the budget into the master budget. Both paths converge, and the process ends.",

In the first path, the most recent budget is reviewed, while in the second path, significant variances are evaluated. After both tasks are completed, the process converges and then splits again into two parallel paths. In the first path, 3-5 goals are prioritized, while in the second path, 3-5 goals are defined. Once both tasks are completed, the process converges and then splits again into two parallel paths. In the first path, the average monthly cost is estimated, while in the second path, the total annual budget is calculated. After the total annual budget is calculated, all department expenses are listed. Once both the average monthly cost estimation and the listing of all department expenses are completed, the process converges and then the total annual income is projected. After projecting the total annual income, the process splits into two parallel paths. In the first path, financial data is recorded in the budget spreadsheet, while in the second path, the budget is finalized. After the budget is finalized, it is incorporated into the master budget, and the process ends. Meanwhile, after recording financial data in the budget spreadsheet, management responsibilities are assigned, and approval is requested from top management. Once approval is requested from top management, the process ends.",

One path involves reviewing the most recent budget, while the other path involves evaluating significant variances. Once both tasks are completed, the process converges and then splits again into two parallel paths. One path involves prioritizing three to five goals, and the other path involves defining three to five goals. After both tasks are completed, the process converges and then splits again into two parallel paths. One path involves estimating the average monthly cost, while the other path involves calculating the total annual budget. \n\nAfter calculating the total annual budget, the next step is to list all department expenses. Once both the average monthly cost and department expenses are listed, the process converges and then splits again into two parallel paths. One path involves projecting the total annual income, and the other path involves recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet. After projecting the total annual income, the process converges and then splits again into two parallel paths. One path involves finalizing the budget, while the other path involves recording financial data in the budget spreadsheet. \n\nOnce the budget is finalized and the financial data is recorded, the process converges and then splits again into two parallel paths. One path involves incorporating the budget into the master budget, while the other path involves assigning management responsibilities. After both tasks are completed, the process converges and the final step is to request approval from top management. The process ends once approval is requested.",

Once the target date is set, the process splits into two parallel tasks: reviewing the most recent budget and evaluating any significant variances. After both tasks are completed, the process converges and proceeds to determine ways of achieving the goals.\n\nNext, the process splits again into two parallel tasks: calculating the total annual budget and estimating the average monthly cost. Once both tasks are completed, the process converges and moves on to project the total annual income.\n\nAfter projecting the total annual income, the process reaches an exclusive decision point. Depending on the outcome, the process either records financial data in a budget spreadsheet or finalizes the budget. Both tasks are performed in parallel.\n\nOnce both tasks are completed, the process converges again and proceeds to request approval from top management and assign management responsibilities. After assigning management responsibilities, the process splits into two parallel tasks: obtaining approval from top management and incorporating the budget into the master budget.\n\nFinally, the process converges and ends with the completion of both tasks.",

In the first path, the recent budget is reviewed, while in the second path, significant variances are evaluated. Both paths then converge, and the process splits again into two parallel paths. In the first path, ways of achieving goals are determined, while in the second path, 3-5 goals are defined. Once the goals are defined, they are prioritized, and the paths converge again.\n\nNext, the process splits into two parallel paths. In the first path, all department expenses are listed, while in the second path, the average monthly cost is estimated. Both paths then converge, and the total annual income is projected. The process then splits into two parallel paths again. In the first path, financial data is recorded in the budget spreadsheet, while in the second path, the budget is finalized. Both paths converge, and the process splits into two parallel paths once more. In the first path, approval is requested from top management, while in the second path, approval is obtained from top management. Finally, both paths converge, and the process ends.",

These two actions happen in parallel. If the customer did not respond, the process moves directly to identifying the root cause(s) of the problem. Similarly, if the customer is willing to talk, the process proceeds to identifying the root cause(s) of the problem.\n\nOnce the root cause(s) of the problem are identified, ideas to increase value are described. Following this, the customer's decision is recorded, and they are thanked for their time and feedback. These two actions happen in parallel.\n\nNext, the process asks if the customer has any other concerns. This leads to noting down important learnings from the conversation and sending these learnings to the appropriate managers. These two actions also happen in parallel.\n\nFinally, the process concludes with the end event after the learnings have been noted and sent to the appropriate managers.",

After the research is completed, the process splits into three parallel tasks: confirming the questionnaire is complete, updating the project management profile, and updating the client's CRM. \n\nOnce the project management profile is updated, the process splits again into two parallel tasks: scheduling future calls and creating the first draft of the marketing plan. \n\nAfter both the scheduling of future calls and the creation of the first draft of the marketing plan are completed, the process converges, and the client is informed of the project start, and work is assigned to the team. \n\nFollowing this, an exclusive decision is made based on the approval of the first draft, the completion of the questionnaire, and the update of the client's CRM. If changes are required based on a follow-up call, these changes are made, and the process ends. \n\nIf no changes are required, the process ends directly.",

After both tasks are completed, they converge, and an exclusive decision is made. \n\nThe process then proceeds with informing the client of the project start and assigning work to the team.

Following this, three tasks are carried out in parallel: scheduling future calls, updating the client's CRM, and updating the project management profile.\n\nOnce the future calls are scheduled, an exclusive decision is made. If the decision leads to getting approval for the first draft, this task is performed. Alternatively, the first draft of the marketing plan is created, followed by researching campaign ideas.\n\nSimultaneously, after updating the project management profile, the questionnaire is confirmed to be complete. Both the completion of the questionnaire and the research of campaign ideas converge, leading to informing the client of the project start.\n\nAfter informing the client, three tasks are carried out in parallel: making changes based on a follow-up call, having the follow-up call, and sending a post-onboarding survey.

If the decision leads to getting approval for the first draft, that task is performed. Alternatively, the first draft of the marketing plan is created, followed by researching campaign ideas.\n\nIn the second parallel path, the client's CRM is updated.\n\nIn the third parallel path, the project management profile is updated. After updating the project management profile, the next task is to confirm that the questionnaire is complete.\n\nIn the fourth parallel path, the client is informed of the project start. This leads to another parallel split where three tasks can occur simultaneously: making changes based on a follow-up call, having a follow-up call, and sending a post-onboarding survey. \n\nEach of these tasks, once completed, leads to the end event, concluding the process.",

The ticket can be classified as an app question, a technical issue, a marketing/PR question, a sales question, or a mixed-type question.\n\nIf the ticket is determined to be a technical issue, it leads to another parallel gateway. From this gateway, the ticket can be further classified as a sales question or a mixed-type question. Additionally, it can lead to another parallel gateway where the technical issues are tested, the issue is replicated, and a response to the ticket question is prepared.\n\nFor tickets classified as an app question, marketing/PR question, sales question, or mixed-type question, the process ends directly after the classification.\n\nFor technical issues, after testing the technical issues, replicating the issue, and responding to the ticket question, the process ends.\n\nIn summary, the process involves checking the ticket type, determining the specific type of ticket, and then either ending the process or further handling technical issues before concluding.",

Once the response to the ticket question is completed, an exclusive gateway checks if all issues could be replicated.\n\nIf all issues could be replicated, the process ends with the completion event. If the issue needs to be replicated, the process proceeds to replicate the issue and then ends with the completion event.",

The ticket can be classified as a Marketing/PR Question, a Technical Issue, a Feature Request, an \"I'm not sure\" question, an App Question, or a Mixed-type question.\n\nIf the ticket is a Marketing/PR Question, it proceeds to another parallel gateway where it can be further classified as a Feature Request or an \"I'm not sure\" question. If it is classified as an \"I'm not sure\" question, it leads to another parallel gateway where it can be further classified as an App Question or a Mixed-type question.\n\nIf the ticket is a Technical Issue, it proceeds to a parallel gateway where the issue can be replicated, the ticket question can be responded to, or the technical issues can be tested.\n\nIf the ticket is a Feature Request, it proceeds to another parallel gateway where the issue can be replicated, the ticket question can be responded to, or the technical issues can be tested.\n\nIf the ticket is an App Question or a Mixed-type question, it proceeds to the same parallel gateway as the Technical Issue, where the issue can be replicated, the ticket question can be responded to, or the technical issues can be tested.\n\nFinally, the process ends with the end event.",

Following the introduction, two tasks are carried out in parallel: providing the job description with responsibilities and preparing the employee's workstation. Once both tasks are completed, the process continues with assigning a mentor and taking the new employee out to lunch, which also occur in parallel. After these tasks, the process proceeds to getting approval and assigning the first project, again in parallel. Once both tasks are completed, the process moves forward with encouraging social interaction with the team and providing reading material for personal growth, which are also done in parallel. Finally, the process concludes with a review of the onboarding process over the next 60 days, and the onboarding process ends.",

One path involves preparing the employee's workstation, while the other involves preparing the benefits package.\n\nOnce the workstation is prepared, the employee discusses their role, goals, and projects with their supervisor. Concurrently, after the benefits package is prepared, two parallel tasks are initiated: creating accounts for the employee and assigning required reading materials.\n\nAfter the accounts are created, three tasks are performed in parallel: preparing employee paperwork, providing the job description with responsibilities, and getting approval. Simultaneously, after the required reading materials are assigned, three additional tasks are performed in parallel: taking the employee out to lunch, assigning training material, and inducting the employee into the company culture.\n\nOnce the employee paperwork is prepared, the job description is provided, and approval is obtained, these tasks converge, and the first project is assigned to the employee. This is followed by another approval and a check of the paperwork.\n\nAfter the first project is assigned, the approval is obtained, and the paperwork is checked, the process continues with two parallel tasks: reviewing the onboarding process over the next 60 days and encouraging social interaction with the team.\n\nFinally, the process concludes with the end event, marking the completion of the onboarding process.",

Following the introduction, two parallel paths are taken: preparing the employee's workstation and preparing the benefits package. Once the workstation is prepared, the employee discusses their role, goals, and projects with their supervisor. Meanwhile, after the benefits package is prepared, two more parallel paths are taken: creating accounts and assigning required reading materials.\n\nOnce the accounts are created, three parallel tasks are performed: preparing employee paperwork, providing the job description with responsibilities, and getting approval on the accounts. After the accounts are approved, three parallel paths are taken: taking the employee out to lunch, assigning training materials, and inducting the employee into the company culture. \n\nAfter the lunch, training, and induction, the process continues with three parallel tasks: assigning the first project, getting approval for the first project, and checking the paperwork. Finally, the process concludes with three parallel tasks: reviewing the onboarding process over the next 60 days, encouraging social interaction with the team, and ending the onboarding process.",

Following the introduction, the job description along with responsibilities is provided. After that, a tour of the office is conducted.\n\nOnce the office tour is completed, the process splits into three parallel tasks. The first task is to get approval, the second task is to explain expectations for the following month, and the third task is to assign the first project.\n\nAfter these three tasks are completed, the process converges again. The next steps are to provide reading material for personal growth and to encourage social interaction with the team.\n\nFollowing these tasks, the process splits into two parallel tasks again. The first task is to explain long-term goals, and the second task is to review the onboarding process over the next 60 days.\n\nFinally, the process ends when both the long-term goals are explained and the onboarding process review is completed.",

Following the introduction, the new employee discusses their role, goals, and projects with their supervisor. \n\nAfter this discussion, the process splits into parallel paths. One path involves assigning training material to the new employee, while another path involves taking the new employee out to lunch. \n\nAfter the lunch, the process again splits into parallel paths. One path involves holding a welcoming ceremony, another path involves explaining expectations to the new employee, and a third path involves giving the new employee a tour of the office. \n\nFollowing the welcoming ceremony, a mentor is assigned to the new employee. Simultaneously, after the expectations are explained, the new employee is inducted into the company culture. \n\nThe process then converges, and the new employee is assigned their first project. \n\nAfter the first project is assigned, the process splits into parallel paths once more. One path involves planning check-in meetings, another path involves explaining long-term goals, and a third path involves providing reading material for personal growth. \n\nFollowing the planning of check-in meetings, the new employee is encouraged to interact socially with the team. \n\nFinally, the onboarding process is reviewed, and the process ends.",

This leads to a parallel gateway where three tasks are initiated simultaneously: assigning training material, taking the new employee out to lunch, and holding a welcoming ceremony.\n\nAfter the lunch, another parallel gateway is reached, initiating three more tasks: holding a welcoming ceremony, explaining expectations, and touring the office. The welcoming ceremony leads to assigning a mentor, while explaining expectations leads to inducting the new employee into the company culture. The tour of the office also leads to the same parallel gateway.\n\nOnce the training material is assigned, the mentor is assigned, the new employee is inducted into the company culture, and the office tour is completed, another parallel gateway is reached. This gateway leads to assigning the first project.\n\nAfter the first project is assigned, another parallel gateway initiates three tasks: planning check-in meetings, explaining long-term goals, and providing reading material for personal growth. The check-in meetings lead to encouraging social interaction with the team, which then leads to the end event. The reading material for personal growth leads to reviewing the onboarding process over the next 60 days, which also leads to the end event. Finally, explaining long-term goals directly leads to the end event.",

Following this, the process splits into two parallel tasks: preparing the employee's workstation and preparing the employee paperwork. Once both tasks are completed, the process converges and splits again into three parallel tasks: assigning a mentor, holding a welcoming ceremony, and assigning training material. After these tasks are completed, the process converges and splits into two parallel tasks: assigning the first project and explaining expectations for the following month. Once these tasks are completed, the process converges and moves to an inclusive gateway. From this gateway, two tasks can be performed: encouraging team social interaction and providing reading material for personal growth. If team social interaction is encouraged, the next step is to plan check-in meetings. The process then converges and ends. If reading material for personal growth is provided, the process returns to the inclusive gateway, allowing for the possibility of performing the other task before ending.",

Following the introduction, the process splits into parallel tasks where accounts are created and approval is obtained simultaneously. Once both tasks are completed, the process converges and the new employee is given a tour of the office, a welcoming ceremony is held, and a mentor is assigned concurrently.\n\nAfter the mentor is assigned, the process splits again into parallel tasks where the mentor explains expectations, inducts the new employee into the company culture, and assigns training material. Once these tasks are completed, the process converges again, and the paperwork is checked.\n\nFollowing the paperwork check, the process splits into inclusive tasks where the long-term goals are explained, the onboarding process is reviewed over the next 60 days, and social interaction with the team is encouraged. The process concludes when all these tasks are completed.",

Following the introduction, two parallel tasks are initiated: creating accounts and getting approval. Once both tasks are completed, the process continues with another set of parallel tasks: touring the office, holding a welcoming ceremony, and assigning a mentor.\n\nAfter the mentor is assigned, three parallel tasks are carried out: explaining expectations, inducting the new employee into the company culture, and assigning training material. Once the induction into the company culture, assignment of training material, and explanation of expectations are completed, the process continues with checking the paperwork and getting approval again.\n\nFollowing the completion of these tasks, the process moves to another set of parallel tasks: explaining long-term goals, reviewing the onboarding process, and encouraging social interaction. Finally, the process concludes with the end event after all these tasks are completed.",

Once these tasks are completed, the process checks for approval again and checks the paperwork.\n\nAfter both the approval and paperwork checks are completed, the process moves to the next phase, which involves three inclusive activities: explaining long-term goals, reviewing the onboarding process over the next 60 days, and encouraging social interaction with the team.

Following this, the process splits into parallel paths.\n\nOne path involves selecting the exam assignment, which then leads to another parallel split. From this split, three tasks are performed in parallel: applying score criteria, applying special grades to individuals, and preparing grades for SSO. The task of applying special grades to individuals leads to importing the gradebook. The task of importing the gradebook is also directly connected to the parallel split.\n\nSimultaneously, the other initial parallel path involves calculating grades, which also leads to the same parallel split where the tasks of applying score criteria, applying special grades to individuals, preparing grades for SSO, and importing the gradebook are performed.\n\nAfter these tasks, the process converges into another parallel split. From this split, two tasks are performed in parallel: reviewing the grades summary and applying any changes. Reviewing the grades summary leads to reviewing the course summary, which then leads to exporting the final grades.\n\nExporting the final grades leads to another parallel split. From this split, two tasks are performed in parallel: sending the examiners the grade approval sheet and submitting the results to SSO. Both of these tasks lead to the end event, concluding the process.",

Simultaneously, the process also continues to the next parallel gateway. After applying the score criteria, the process converges and proceeds to review the grades summary. \n\nFollowing the review, the final grades are exported.

Once this is done, three tasks are initiated in parallel: importing the gradebook, selecting the exam assignment, and applying special grades to individuals.\n\nAfter the gradebook is imported, the grades are calculated. The calculated grades are then reviewed in a summary. Following the review, two tasks are executed in parallel: exporting the course summary and exporting the final grades.\n\nIf the grades need to be recalculated, this is done next. After recalculating the grades, two tasks are performed in parallel: getting approval signatures from the course director and submitting the results to the SSO.\n\nOnce the results are submitted to the SSO, the examiner's grade approval sheet is sent, and the process concludes with the end event.",

In the first path, the grades are calculated, and in the second path, special grades are applied to individuals.\n\nAfter the grades are calculated, the process splits again into two parallel tasks. One task involves preparing the grades for the SSO, while the other involves selecting the exam assignment.\n\nOnce the grades are prepared for the SSO and the exam assignment is selected, the process converges and then splits into two parallel tasks. One task involves applying any changes, and the other involves reviewing the course summary.\n\nAfter applying any changes and reviewing the course summary, the process converges again into a single task of reviewing the grades summary. Following the review of the grades summary, the process splits into five parallel tasks.\n\nThe first task involves exporting the final grades. The second task involves recalculating the grades. The third task involves exporting the course summary. The fourth task involves sending the examiner's grade approval sheet. The fifth task involves submitting the results to the SSO.\n\nEach of these five tasks leads to the end event, marking the completion of the process.",

Once this form is completed, two parallel tasks are initiated: the borrower completes the loan application, and the credit department receives the application. \n\nAfter both tasks are completed, an exclusive decision is made. If the application needs to be sent back to the applicant, it is sent back, and if a written notice needs to be given to the applicant, the notice is provided. Both of these tasks lead to a parallel gateway.\n\nFollowing this, the credit department begins the underwriting process and checks the credit score and risk score in parallel. Once these tasks are completed, another parallel gateway is reached, leading to two tasks: changing the interest rate and approving the loan application.\n\nIf the interest rate is changed, the loan amount is reduced, and this leads to a parallel gateway. If the loan application is approved, it also leads to the same parallel gateway. \n\nFinally, the borrower receives the loan funds, and the process concludes with the end event.",

Once this is completed, the borrower completes the loan application. \n\nAfter the loan application is completed, the process splits into two parallel tasks. One task involves giving written notice to the applicant, and the other task involves checking the application for completeness. \n\nIf the application is not complete, it is sent back to the applicant. Once the application is complete, the underwriting process begins. \n\nFollowing the underwriting process, the application is evaluated through an exclusive decision gateway. Depending on the outcome, one of four actions is taken: changing the interest rate, approving the loan application, reducing the loan amount, or receiving the loan funds. \n\nFinally, the process concludes with the end event.",

If the application is found to be incomplete, a written notice is given to the applicant. This notice is followed by the initiation of two parallel tasks: beginning the underwriting process and checking the credit score and risk score.\n\nIf the application is complete, the process directly moves to the parallel tasks of beginning the underwriting process and checking the credit score and risk score. \n\nOnce both the underwriting process and the credit score and risk score checks are completed, the loan application is approved.

If a shipping label is to be attached, it is done directly.\n\nAfter obtaining approval, the process continues with measuring the products and packaging the items securely. These two tasks are performed in parallel.\n\nOnce the products are measured, there is another decision point where either an invoice is printed or a packing slip is printed. If an invoice is printed, it proceeds to the next step. If a packing slip is printed, it also proceeds to the next step.\n\nFollowing the printing of either the invoice or the packing slip, there is another decision point where the items are either loaded into the delivery vehicle, the delivery is arranged, or the orders are examined for delivery overlaps. Depending on the decision, the respective task is performed.\n\nAfter loading the items into the delivery vehicle, arranging the delivery, or examining the orders, a confirmation email is sent to the customer.\n\nFinally, the process ends with the end event.",

In the third path, approval is obtained. After the products are measured, the process splits into two parallel paths where the shipping label is attached and the packing slip is printed. Once the items are packaged securely, approval is obtained, the shipping label is attached, and the packing slip is printed, the process converges again. The items are then loaded into the delivery vehicle. After loading, the process splits into two parallel paths. In the first path, a confirmation email is sent. Finally, the process ends.",

Once the order details are recorded, two parallel tasks are initiated: checking if the products are in stock and recording the products taken from storage. \n\nIf the products are in stock, a request for the ordered products is sent to the inventory. Simultaneously, the products taken from storage undergo quality checks. \n\nAfter the inventory request and quality checks, the process converges, and two tasks are executed in parallel: packaging the items securely and getting approval. \n\nOnce approval is obtained, three parallel tasks are performed: printing the packing slip, measuring the products, and attaching the shipping label. \n\nAfter attaching the shipping label, the invoice is printed. The printed invoice is then used to load the items into the delivery vehicle. \n\nFinally, a confirmation email is sent to the customer, and the process concludes with the completion of order fulfillment.",

Once the packing slip is printed, three parallel activities are triggered: getting approval for the packing slip, packaging the items securely, and measuring the products.\n\nAfter the approval for the packing slip, packaging of items, and measurement of products are completed, the process moves forward to load the items into the delivery vehicle, arrange the delivery, and examine orders for delivery overlaps, all of which happen concurrently.\n\nFinally, after loading the items, arranging the delivery, and examining the orders, a confirmation email is sent, marking the end of the process.",

Once the payment is confirmed, three tasks are initiated in parallel: recording the products taken from storage, performing quality checks, and requesting the ordered products from inventory.\n\nAfter these three tasks are completed, they converge, and the process continues with printing the packing slip and getting approval, which also occur in parallel.\n\nOnce the packing slip is printed, an exclusive decision is made. Depending on the outcome, the process either proceeds to packaging the items securely or printing the invoice. If the invoice is printed, the products are then measured.\n\nBoth the packaging of items and the measuring of products lead to examining the orders for delivery overlaps. Finally, a confirmation email is sent, and the process concludes with the end event.",

In the first path, it is confirmed whether the process requires optimization. In the second path, the process components are identified. Both paths converge to define the completion time and look to simplify the process.\n\nIf the process requires optimization, the next step is to assess if any steps are confusing. Following this, potential process improvements are written down. These improvements are then submitted for approval. Once approved, the updated process is used, and the process documents are updated. Feedback on the updated process is also added.\n\nSimultaneously, after the process components are identified, the completion time is defined, and the process is simplified. The improvements are then determined, and the next step is to choose who will test the updated process. This leads back to the parallel gateway, where the process splits again.\n\nIn the next parallel paths, the process is monitored, the next process review and optimization are scheduled, and the process changes are implemented. Finally, the process ends.",

Following this assessment, potential process improvements are written down. These improvements are then submitted for approval.\n\nOnce the process improvements are approved, the process splits into three parallel tasks: using the updated process, defining what would make the improvements successful, and determining what improvements should go forward. After using the updated process, the process converges and splits into several tasks: updating the process documents, adding feedback on the updated process, and choosing who will test the updated process.\n\nThe task of choosing who will test the updated process converges back into the process, which then continues with determining how the process will be monitored, scheduling the next process review and optimization, and implementing the process changes.

Following this, potential process improvements are written down. These improvements are then submitted for approval. Once approved, the process splits into two parallel tasks again: using the updated process and defining success criteria for the improvements.\n\nAfter these tasks are completed, the process converges into another parallel gateway.

Once this is done, the process splits into two parallel tasks: identifying process components and assessing process performance. After assessing process performance, it is confirmed whether the process requires optimization. Both the identification of process components and the confirmation of the need for optimization converge at the next parallel gateway.\n\nFollowing this, the time to complete the process is defined. Then, potential process improvements are written down. These improvements are then submitted for approval. Once approved, the process splits again into two parallel tasks: using the updated process and defining success criteria for the improvements.\n\nAfter these tasks are completed, the process changes are communicated, and the next process review and optimization are scheduled. The communication of process changes leads to the implementation of process changes. Both the implementation of process changes and the scheduling of the next process review converge at the final parallel gateway, which leads to the end event, marking the completion of the process.",

One path involves assessing process performance, while the other involves identifying process components. Both of these tasks lead to an inclusive gateway.\n\nFrom the inclusive gateway, two tasks are performed: noting automatable steps and assessing confusing steps. After assessing confusing steps, the process converges at a parallel gateway.\n\nAt this parallel gateway, two tasks are performed simultaneously: defining process completion time and simplifying process steps. Simplifying process steps leads to another inclusive gateway.\n\nFrom this inclusive gateway, two tasks are performed: considering bottlenecks and examining potentially wasteful steps. Meanwhile, defining process completion time leads to a parallel gateway.\n\nAt this parallel gateway, the tasks of considering bottlenecks, examining potentially wasteful steps, and noting automatable steps converge. The process then continues with writing potential process improvements.\n\nAfter writing potential process improvements, the next step is to get approval for these improvements. Once approval is obtained, the process documents are updated. Finally, the process changes are communicated, and the process ends.",

One path involves confirming if the process requires optimization, while the other involves identifying the process components. Both of these tasks are completed in parallel.\n\nAfter confirming if the process requires optimization and identifying the process components, the process converges and splits again into three parallel tasks. These tasks are defining the time to complete the process, noting steps for automation, and considering bottlenecks.\n\nOnce the time to complete the process is defined, the process splits into two parallel tasks: assessing confusing steps and simplifying the process. Meanwhile, the consideration of bottlenecks and noting steps for automation lead to writing potential process improvements.\n\nThe task of examining potentially wasteful steps also leads to writing potential process improvements. After potential process improvements are written, the next step is to get approval for these improvements.\n\nUpon approval, the process splits into two parallel tasks: determining which improvements will go forward and adding feedback on the updated process. Additionally, the process splits into another parallel path involving determining how the process will be monitored and communicating process changes.\n\nFinally, the process ends after these tasks are completed.",

Following this, the process splits into three parallel tasks: considering where bottlenecks occur, looking to see if the process can be simplified, and defining how long it takes to complete the process.\n\nAfter looking to see if the process can be simplified, the process splits again into two parallel tasks: examining potentially wasteful steps and assessing if any steps are confusing. Both of these tasks lead to writing potential process improvements.\n\nOnce potential process improvements are written, the next step is to get approval for these improvements. After approval, the process splits into two parallel tasks: adding feedback on the updated process and updating process documents.\n\nAdding feedback on the updated process and updating process documents both lead to another split into three parallel tasks: scheduling the next process review and optimization, communicating process changes, and determining how the process will be monitored.\n\nCommunicating process changes leads to implementing process changes.

Following this assessment, the process splits into three parallel paths. \n\nIn the first path, the occurrence of bottlenecks is considered. In the second path, efforts are made to simplify the process. In the third path, the process completion time is defined. \n\nAfter the process is simplified, two parallel tasks are initiated: examining potentially wasteful steps and assessing if any steps are confusing. \n\nThe results from considering bottlenecks, defining process completion time, examining wasteful steps, and assessing confusing steps converge into writing potential process improvements. \n\nThese potential improvements are then submitted for approval. Once approved, the process splits into two parallel paths again. \n\nIn the first path, feedback on the updated process is added. In the second path, process documents are updated. \n\nThe feedback and updated documents converge into scheduling the next process review and optimization, determining how the process will be monitored, and communicating process changes. \n\nFinally, the process changes are implemented, and the process ends.",

One path involves assessing the performance of the process, while the other involves identifying the process components. After identifying the process components, it is confirmed whether the process requires optimization. Both paths then converge, and the process splits again into two parallel paths. One path involves assessing if any steps are confusing, while the other involves noting which steps can be automated. These paths converge, and the process splits again into two parallel paths. One path involves defining how long it takes to complete the process, while the other involves examining potentially wasteful steps. These paths converge, and the process continues with writing potential process improvements. The next step is to get approval for the process improvements. Once approved, the process splits into two parallel paths. One path involves using the updated process, while the other involves determining what improvements should go forward. These paths converge, and the process splits again into two parallel paths. One path involves communicating the process changes, while the other involves scheduling the next process review and optimization. Finally, the process ends.",

Meanwhile, the consideration of bottlenecks leads directly to examining potentially wasteful steps.\n\nNext, the process involves writing potential process improvements, followed by getting approval for these improvements. Once approved, two tasks are carried out in parallel: defining what would make the improvements successful and choosing who will test the updated process.\n\nAfter selecting the testers, the process continues with another parallel set of tasks: updating the process documents and using the updated process. \n\nBoth tasks converge at an exclusive gateway, which then leads to a parallel set of tasks: communicating the process changes and implementing the process changes. \n\nFinally, the process ends after both the communication and implementation of the process changes are completed.",

In one path, the time it takes to complete the process is defined, and it is examined if the process can be simplified. In the other path, potentially wasteful steps are examined. These paths converge, and potential process improvements are written.\n\nThe process then proceeds to get approval for the proposed improvements. Once approved, the process splits into two parallel paths again. In one path, what would make the improvements successful is defined, and in the other path, the individuals who will test the updated process are chosen.

Once the introduction is made, the process splits into three parallel tasks: recording the basic idea, working out its value, and identifying the approval status.\n\nAfter recording the basic idea, the next step is getting approval. Meanwhile, the tasks of working out its value and identifying the approval status converge and proceed together with the approval task.\n\nOnce these tasks are completed, the process moves forward to another parallel split where three tasks are carried out simultaneously: laying out a timeline, stating the available resources, and drawing up a project plan.\n\nAfter these tasks are completed, they converge and lead to having a kickoff meeting. Following the kickoff meeting, the process splits again into two parallel tasks: keeping communication and recording KPIs.\n\nOnce both tasks are completed, they converge and lead to evaluating project outcomes.

After getting approval, the process converges with the other two parallel tasks (working out its value and identifying the approval status) and proceeds to the next set of parallel tasks: laying out a timeline, stating available resources, and drawing up a project plan.\n\nAfter these three tasks are completed, the process converges again and moves on to having a kickoff meeting. Following the kickoff meeting, the process splits into two parallel tasks: keeping communication and recording KPIs.\n\nOnce both tasks are completed, the process converges one final time and proceeds to evaluate the project outcomes.

Once the introduction is made, the process splits into three parallel tasks: recording the basic idea, working out its value, and identifying the approval status.\n\nAfter recording the basic idea, the next step is getting approval. Meanwhile, the tasks of working out its value and identifying the approval status also converge at the same point. Once all three tasks are completed, the process moves forward in parallel to laying out a timeline, stating the available resources, and drawing up a project plan.\n\nThese three tasks are then completed in parallel and converge to the task of having a kickoff meeting. Following the kickoff meeting, the process splits again into two parallel tasks: keeping communication and recording KPIs.\n\nOnce both tasks are completed, they converge to the task of evaluating project outcomes.

Following the introduction, two parallel tasks are initiated: identifying the approval status and getting approval. Once both tasks are completed, they converge into another parallel gateway, leading to the task of drawing up a project plan. After the project plan is drawn up, a kickoff meeting is held.\n\nFollowing the kickoff meeting, two parallel tasks are initiated: recording KPIs and keeping communication. Once both tasks are completed, they converge into an exclusive gateway. At this point, there are two possible paths: if the decision is to terminate contractors, the process proceeds to the task of terminating contractors, followed by evaluating project outcomes, and finally ending the process. Alternatively, if the decision is to ensure project completion, the process proceeds directly to ensuring project completion, and then ends the process.",

Following this, the process splits into three parallel paths. \n\nIn the first path, the basic idea is recorded. In the second path, the approval status is identified. In the third path, the value of the idea is worked out. \n\nOnce the approval status is identified, the process splits again into two parallel paths. One path involves working out the value of the idea, and the other path involves getting approval. \n\nAfter the value is worked out and approval is obtained, these paths join back together with the path where the basic idea was recorded. \n\nNext, the process splits into three parallel paths again. One path involves laying out a timeline, another involves drawing up a project plan, and the third involves setting a budget. \n\nAfter the project plan is drawn up, the available resources are stated. The paths of laying out a timeline, drawing up a project plan, and setting a budget then join together. \n\nFollowing this, a kickoff meeting is held. After the kickoff meeting, the KPIs are recorded. \n\nThe process then joins together again and splits into two parallel paths. One path involves evaluating project outcomes, and the other path ensures the project is completed. \n\nIf the project outcomes are evaluated, contractors are terminated. Finally, the process ends.",

One path involves recording the basic idea, while the other path involves identifying the approval status.\n\nOnce the approval status is identified, the process splits again into two parallel paths. One path involves working out the value of the idea, and the other path involves getting approval.\n\nAfter both the value is worked out and approval is obtained, the process converges and splits into three parallel paths. These paths involve laying out a timeline, drawing up a project plan, and setting a budget.\n\nOnce the project plan is drawn up, the process continues with stating the available resources. Meanwhile, the timeline and budget paths converge with the resources path, leading to a kickoff meeting.\n\nFollowing the kickoff meeting, the process involves recording the key performance indicators (KPIs). After recording the KPIs, the process splits into two paths: evaluating project outcomes and ensuring the project is completed.\n\nIf the project outcomes are evaluated, the process continues with terminating contractors. Both paths, whether the project is completed or contractors are terminated, lead to the end of the process.",

One path involves getting approval, while the other involves identifying the approval status.\n\nOnce approval is obtained, the process moves to an inclusive gateway where three tasks can occur in parallel: working out its value, recording the basic idea, and drawing up a project plan. The project plan task further splits into three parallel tasks: setting a budget, stating the available resources, and laying out a timeline.\n\nAfter setting a budget, the process flows to laying out a timeline. Once the project plan, budget, and resources are all laid out, the process converges at a parallel gateway, leading to a kickoff meeting.\n\nFollowing the kickoff meeting, the process splits into three parallel tasks: recording KPIs, keeping communication, and ensuring the project is completed. Finally, the process concludes with an end event after ensuring the project is completed.",

After determining the value, a timeline is laid out. This is followed by having a kickoff meeting. Subsequently, key performance indicators (KPIs) are recorded.\n\nAfter recording the KPIs, the process splits again into two parallel tasks: evaluating project outcomes and ensuring the project is completed. If the project outcomes are evaluated, the next step is to terminate contractors. The process concludes with an end event after either ensuring the project is completed or terminating contractors.",

If the approval status is not approved, the process loops back to re-identify the approval status. Once all approvals are obtained, the process moves forward in parallel to lay out a timeline and draw up a project plan. After both the timeline and project plan are completed, the process converges and proceeds to have a kickoff meeting. Following the kickoff meeting, the process continues in parallel to keep communication and record KPIs. Once both communication is maintained and KPIs are recorded, the process evaluates the project outcomes. Finally, the process concludes with the end event.",

Once both tasks are completed, the process converges again.\n\nThe next step is to get approval from the supplier. After the supplier's approval, the process diverges into two parallel paths.

The supplier is informed that the order is ready for approval, and a purchase order is created simultaneously.\n\nOnce the supplier is informed and the purchase order is created, the process converges again, and the supplier's approval is sought. After the supplier approves, the process diverges into two parallel tasks: confirming the delivery date and recording the purchase order.\n\nFinally, after the delivery date is confirmed, the purchase order is filed.

Simultaneously, in the second path, the supplier is informed that the order is ready for approval. Both paths converge when the supplier's approval is obtained.\n\nAfter the supplier's approval, the process splits into three parallel paths. In the first path, the purchase order is recorded. In the second path, the details are sent to the relevant department.

Once this is completed, the process splits into two parallel paths. \n\nIn the first path, the product market share is specified, and plans for future products are made. These two tasks converge into another parallel gateway.\n\nIn the second path, the number of employees is reviewed, and the business plan is reviewed. Following the review of the business plan, the enthusiasm, team chemistry, and expertise are reviewed in parallel. These tasks converge into another parallel gateway.\n\nAfter the parallel reviews of enthusiasm, team chemistry, and expertise, the employee salary and benefits are reviewed, and the company mission and direction are reviewed. Additionally, the ability as a team leader is reviewed, which leads to the review of the relationship to the founder and the review of trustworthiness. These tasks converge into an exclusive gateway.\n\nFrom the exclusive gateway, the process continues with checking the cash flow and checking the exit strategy. These tasks are followed by checking the current debt and checking the income statements, which converge into another exclusive gateway.\n\nFrom this exclusive gateway, the reputation of the competition is analyzed, followed by checking the insurance.

If the decision is to specify the product market share, this task is completed. Simultaneously, plans for future products are made. Both tasks lead to a parallel review of the number of employees and the business plan.\n\nAfter reviewing the business plan, there is another decision point. Depending on the outcome, the enthusiasm, team chemistry, and expertise are reviewed. These reviews are conducted in parallel. Once these reviews are completed, the employee salary and benefits, company mission and direction, and the ability as a team leader are reviewed in parallel.\n\nFollowing the review of the ability as a team leader, there is another parallel review of the relationship to the founder and trustworthiness. Meanwhile, from the initial parallel gateway, there is another decision point that leads to checking the cash flow and exit strategy. After checking the cash flow, the current debt is checked, and after checking the exit strategy, the income statements are checked. Both tasks lead to analyzing the reputation of the competition.\n\nFinally, the insurance is checked, and the process ends.",

Once this task is completed, three tasks are initiated in parallel: specifying product details, specifying product market size, and specifying product rate of growth.\n\nAfter specifying the product rate of growth, the task of making plans for future products is carried out. This is followed by a review of the ability as a team leader, which then leads to checking quarterly projections. The next step involves analyzing the growth stage of the competition.\n\nFollowing the analysis, three tasks are initiated in parallel: checking trademarks, checking past lawsuits, and checking insurance. Once the task of checking trademarks is completed, the task of checking patents is performed.\n\nMeanwhile, the tasks of specifying product details and specifying product market size converge and lead to the end event.

Once this is completed, three tasks are carried out in parallel: specifying product details, specifying the product market size, and specifying the product rate of growth. After specifying the product rate of growth, plans for future products are made. Following this, the ability as a team leader is reviewed. Next, quarterly projections are checked, and the growth stage of the competition is analyzed. \n\nAfter analyzing the growth stage of the competition, an exclusive decision is made to check trademarks, check past lawsuits, or check insurance.

Following this, the process branches out into three parallel tasks: specifying the product market share, checking the location of the startup, and conducting a SWOT analysis.\n\nOnce the location of the startup is checked, plans for future products are made. After specifying the product market share, the process converges with the completion of the SWOT analysis and the planning for future products, leading to three parallel tasks: reviewing the number of employees, reviewing the business plan, and reviewing the company mission and direction.\n\nAfter reviewing the number of employees, the enthusiasm is reviewed. The review of the company mission and direction leads to another branching point where the trustworthiness and the ability as a team leader are reviewed in parallel.\n\nThe review of trustworthiness leads to another branching point where the team chemistry, expertise, exit strategy, and cash flow are reviewed in parallel. The review of expertise also leads to the review of the exit strategy and cash flow, which then converge into another branching point.\n\nFrom this point, the reputation of the competition and the exact competition are analyzed in parallel. Finally, the trademarks are checked, and the process concludes with the end event.",

Once this task is completed, the process splits into parallel paths. \n\nOne path involves specifying the product's rate of growth, while another path involves specifying the product's market share. After specifying the product's rate of growth, the process splits again into three parallel tasks: specifying the product's market size, checking the location of the startup, and specifying the product details.\n\nOnce the product's market size, location of the startup, and product details are specified, the process converges and proceeds to review the expertise and review the business plan in parallel. After reviewing the business plan, the process continues to review team chemistry.\n\nFollowing the review of team chemistry, the process splits into two parallel tasks: checking the cash flow and checking the exit strategy. Once both tasks are completed, the process converges again to project the market share. \n\nAfter projecting the market share, the process continues to check patents. Finally, the process ends with the completion of the task to check patents.",

Once this task is completed, the process splits into parallel paths. \n\nOne path involves specifying the product's rate of growth, while another path involves specifying the product's market share. After these tasks are completed, the process converges and splits again into three parallel tasks: specifying the product's market size, checking the location of the startup, and specifying the product details.\n\nOnce these tasks are completed, the process converges again and splits into two parallel tasks: reviewing expertise and reviewing the business plan. After the business plan is reviewed, the process continues with reviewing team chemistry.\n\nFollowing the review of team chemistry, the process converges and splits into two parallel tasks: checking cash flow and checking the exit strategy. Once these tasks are completed, the process converges again and proceeds to project the market share.\n\nAfter projecting the market share, the process continues with checking patents.
